  - Sometimes the best defense is a strong... maybe a really strong... offense
  - When enemies are stunned... they can't hurt you...
  - Clockwork used to be peaceful workers of the Depths... that is until the Maddening
  - The Maddening drove the Clockwork mad... in what way exactly?
  - Clockwork attack the Wardens... not out of malice though, but out of instinct?
  - Clockwork have a glowing core for a heart... does that mean they're more than
    machine?
  - Clockwork, creatures built from metal, do they have a soul?
  - Gaia, the first region in the Clockwork Depths, here is where the food is grown
  - Those in the Tower don't fret about food due to the sheer abundance from Gaia
  - Clockwork in the Gaia Depths were designed for farming and processing in mind
  - The Gaia Depths were meant to be farms... not a battlefield of Clockwork
  - Some say Clockwork of the Gaia Depths formed a farming community... ???
  - The Clockwork Tower, a city built into the sky with the Depths designed to feed
    it
  - The Depths of the Clockwork Tower connect through the Spindle
  - The Spindle carries resources from the Depths up to the Tower
  - Those who live in the Clockwork Tower rely on the produce of the Depths to survive
  - Ever since the Maddening, the Depths have stopped production
  - The Warden was sent into the Clockwork Depths to investigate the Maddening
  - Wardens are easy to replace, when one dies, another fills his place... yet...
  - How do the Wardens share knowledge? Is this voice mine or anothers?
  - I woke up in the Depths a Warden, before that, I can't remember exactly
  - Wardens serve as the Tower's way of maintaining the automated machines of the
    Depths
