  - Looks like the Clockworks did go mad, a Maddening... I'll have to defeat all
    of them on each floor before I descend to the Clockwork Heart
  - I can use their scraps to build an Augment to help me. Augments help you in battle,
    you get them at the end of every wave of enemies. Some augments are Stances,
    press [TAB] to switch between them.
